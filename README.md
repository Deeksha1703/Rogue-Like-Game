# Rogue-Like-Game

A text-based "rogue-like" game developed using Java. SOLID object oriented design principles have been applied, ensuring maintainability and extensibility of the application.

## To run the application

All the classes that were created can be found in the ```src/game``` folder.
In order to run the application, you should run the ``` Application.java ``` file, which can be found in the worldmap package.

## Documentation
There are 2 folders containing the documentation, namely the assignment 2 design docs and the assignment 3 design docs folders which contain the following documents, in various stages of development:
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams 
- Design Rationale
